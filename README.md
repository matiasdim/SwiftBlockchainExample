# üß± SwiftBlockchainExample

An experimental project built in **Swift** that implements a **basic blockchain** from scratch.  
Its goal is to provide a hands-on way to understand how blocks, hashing, and immutability work under the hood.

---

## üéØ Purpose

This project is an educational base to explore the core concepts behind technologies like **Bitcoin**, **Ethereum**, and other distributed networks.

It serves as the first step in a broader journey to explore the intersection between **iOS development and Blockchain/Web3**.

---

## üß© Main Features

- 100% **Swift** implementation  
- **No external dependencies**  
- Uses **SHA256 hashing** to link blocks  
- Great starting point for experiments with **WalletConnect**, **transaction signing**, and **smart contract integration**

---

## üß† Concepts Demonstrated

| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Block** | The basic unit of the blockchain. Contains data, its own hash, and the hash of the previous block. |
| **Blockchain** | A linked list of blocks ensuring data integrity and immutability. |
| **Hashing (SHA256)** | Cryptographic function that generates a unique fingerprint for the block‚Äôs data. |
| **Immutability** | Any change to a previous block invalidates the entire chain. |

---

## üíª Core Code

The core logic lives in the `Block` and `Blockchain` structures, which handle block creation, chaining, and validation:

```swift
struct Block {
   let index: Int
    let timestamp: TimeInterval
    let data: String
    let previousHash: String
    var nonce: Int
    var hash: String
}
```

```swift
final class Blockchain: ObservableObject {
    @Published private(set) var chain: [Block] = []
    
    func addBlock(data: String) {
        let previousBlock = latest()
        let new = Block(index: previousBlock.index, data: data, previuosHash: previousBlock.hash, difficulty: difficulty)
        DispatchQueue.main.async { [weak self] in
            self?.chain.append(new)
        }
    }
}
```

Each block references the hash of the previous one, ensuring the **integrity of the entire chain**.

## üß≠ Next Steps

This repository will serve as the foundation for future experiments:

- [ ] Add **Proof of Work (PoW)**
- [ ] Visualize the blockchain using **SwiftUI**
- [ ] Implement **digital signatures** for data or transactions
- [ ] Connect to a real **Ethereum smart contract** via **WalletConnect**
- [ ] Integrate with an iOS **crypto wallet**
